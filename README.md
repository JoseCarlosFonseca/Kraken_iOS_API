# Kraken_iOS_API
Kraken Exchange iOS API Client example

The Kraken web site (https://www.kraken.com/help/api#example-api-code) has some API client examples, but unfortunately it lacks one for the iOS platform
This project fills this gap by providing an easy to use working example
It was created with Xcode 10 and uses Swift 4.2

This project implements the access to the following Kraken APIs, both public and private:

Public Market Data:
  Time
  Ticker
  Trades
  OHLC
  
Private User Data:
  Balance
  Trade Balance
  Trades History
  Open Orders
  
Private User Trading:
  Add Order
